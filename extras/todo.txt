-adapt keypress and key masks for ubuntu, mouse_hook also needs adaptation for mlx-linux
-change btw maps with arrow

//features
-change the bg and the main color of the map (like from white to some other)
- compile multiple files at the same time, both with single file mod
- animate, blur or some other motion effects

//window size
-choose the size from terminal (in make run 1000 1200) or in make or in some settings...
-change the window size with the mouse hold of the corner and/or keyboard shortcut (kinda Super+/Super-)
-choose the size of window before open (with optional argv and macros set up),
    if there is an opportunity to make "fullscreen" mode and back, or resize with mouse holding
    the corner of the window? And how to remember the state of the map before and put it to the new-opened window then?
    Or there is an opportunity to resize the same window without close and reopen it momentally ?


- resize the window with the mouse on the corner ??
