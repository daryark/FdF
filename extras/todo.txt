//overall: 
✅ Makefile, makefile for both ubuntu and macos
- header and macros for LINUX, OSX
✅ objs into separate folder
✅ connect libft
✅ run fancy @curl fdf compilation, or echo like Erwin did (done, differently, works).

❗️CHECK FOR LEAKS❗️
//process
✅ error handle
✅ parse the map:
    ✅ link all in header
    ✅ read
    ✅ init empty map
    ✅ preformat data
    ✅ fill the map
    ✅ clean code and add valuable comments, if needed
draw the map:
    ✅ open the screen
    ✅ draw the line just to see it
    ✅ draw the line with algorithm (bresenham)
    ✅ zoom the original map to adjust for screen size

    - move map to the center
    - do the projection
    - do the menu overlay as a separate layer with some opacity on top of the map 
        (but so it will not change when map movement is triggered)
    -calculate the gap btw two points according to the size of screen
    -do the calculations, do the calculations for nearest pixel opacity
    -draw the picture on the screen

//features
-add colors
-change the bg and the main color of the map (like from white to some other)
- compile multiple files at the same time, both with single file mod
- animate, blur or some other motion effects

//moves and interraction
-change btw maps with arrow
-move the image with the mouse translate and rotate
-zoom

//window size
-choose the size from terminal (in make run 1000 1200) or in make or in some settings...
-change the window size with the mouse hold of the corner and/or keyboard shortcut (kinda Super+/Super-)
-choose the size of window before open (with optional argv and macros set up),
    if there is an opportunity to make "fullscreen" mode and back, or resize with mouse holding
    the corner of the window? And how to remember the state of the map before and put it to the new-opened window then?
    Or there is an opportunity to resize the same window without close and reopen it momentally ?


- resize the window with the mouse on the corner ??
