TODO UPGRADE:
-adapt keypress and key masks for ubuntu, mouse_hook also needs adaptation for mlx-linux
-change btw maps with arrow (draw arrow on mouse hold on left right 50px), on click - change map
- add color variants
- add colors animations
- modify menu (more explanation, multi move and other presses)
- add fullscreen mode

//suggestions about some features
- animate, blur or some other motion effects
-change the window size with the mouse hold of the corner or F keypress
-choose the size of window before open (with optional argv and macros set up),
    if there is an opportunity to make "fullscreen" mode and back, or resize with mouse holding
    the corner of the window? And how to remember the state of the map before and put it to the new-opened window then?
    Or there is an opportunity to resize the same window without close and reopen it momentally ?
